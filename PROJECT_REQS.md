# Project Requirements

This project shall be able to train Monocular Visual SLAM on drone dataset

This project shall be able to test Monocular Visual SLAM on random image sequences and videos 

The training process shall be monitored.

The training loss shall be the same as the SOTA implementations on the SLAM field.

The slam algorithm shall produce 6dof trajectory and 3d world map from images.

The Image shall be converted to hsl space 

The final algorithm shall be able to run on nvidia jetson 2GB real time.

The deep learning architecture shall be flexible by creating config files, and able to run different state of the art image/objection classifiers 

The deep learning architecture shall be compatible with other known repositories (mmdet, darknet)
